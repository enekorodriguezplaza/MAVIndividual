Individual Assignment for the course AE4317

The items required to reproduce this assignment consist of the following parts:

1) Google Collab notebook Autonomous Gate Detection.ipynb: contains all the code required and indications step by step on how to reproduce the results of the report.

2) Google drive folder used for the results. A link to it is also on the google colab. One can simply copy this onto their own 'My Drive' for the reproduction. To fully reproduce the results one can also create the contents of this google drive folder from scratch, with the instructions of the Colab itself. The Google drive mentioned in the notebook can also be found here:  https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1k4JF2DJfzOusfgsQVGJfNRiZNfo2f0Ni?usp=sharing

3) Excel file used to generate the ROC curves (ROC.xlsx). It was done in excel because it would be easier to keep track on how many gates have exactly which test images, as these will change with new runs of the detector.

In case there were any issues in the reproducibility of the results please contact me at rodriguezplazaeneko@gmail.com
